# Front-end-Engineer-React-London-WIRED-Top-100-Start-up-Up-to-75-000

This company is hot, hot, hot. Yeah, I know, every company claims to be disruptive and game-changing, but this company has been named regularly as one of the most disruptive companies in the world, looking at taking a huge gamble to tackle a serious problem. The client in question is looking to fix the retail industry, appreciate that the high street is dying, and building an innovative platform to fix this.

About the role
This role is working on an innovative pop-up marketplace platform, looking at how you can use free space on high streets to rent out to smaller start-ups and retail companies. It gives an opportunity for these companies to get their name out, showcase what they can do and build themselves a name, all while the landlords don't lose out on their property space. You'll be working across their core platform, their style guides, as well as creating the best possible experience.

What skills do you need?
They're on the look-out for a strong web developer, with the key skills being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience in building single page applications is a must, preferably with React, but the client is well aware that a strong JavaScript developer will pick up frameworks. The company is very brand-aware, and having good appreciation for design or interfaces is a massive plus.

Please submit your details for more information about this opportunity.
